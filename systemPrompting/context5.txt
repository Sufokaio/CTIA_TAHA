This is a document to learn how to rewrite sentences using ONLY a specific vocabulary. This document explains when each possible vocabulary should be added.
When you want to do something, you always have to load the dataset first, each rewrited input, whether the dataset is mentioned or not and whether its clustering or regression, will start with "Load dataset".
If volume or density is mentioned you will have to add the following part accordingly: "calculate volume," or "calculate density,"
If the input contains something about number of types, variety, identifying types, etc.. then it is a clustering, you will add "cluster" and the attribute or attributes used to the output and finally add "count clusters" and write NOTHING about regression.
If the input contains something about training a model, regression, prediction, etc.. then it is a regression, first add "split dataset," then you will add "perform regression on" with the dependent variable and "using" with the independent variables used and finally add "calculate MSE" and write NOTHING about clusters.
