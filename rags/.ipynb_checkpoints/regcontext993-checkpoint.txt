# Context:
- Use regression-vocabulary for inputs involving model training, regression, prediction or estimation.
- Simple attributes: id, mass, height, surface.
- Complex attributes: volume, density.

# Vocabulary:
- Regression-vocabulary: load, dataset, calculate, regression, data, perform, on, calculate, using, split, MSE.

# Instructions:
1. Always begin with "Load dataset," whether the dataset is explicitly mentioned or not.
2. If a complex attribute is mentioned in the input, follow with "calculate [complex-attribute(s)],".
3. Follow with "split dataset,"
4. Follow with "perform regression on [dependent attribute] using [independent attribute(s)],"
5. Conclude with "calculate MSE."

# Example input and expected response:

- Example with 1 complex attribute:
Input: "Predict volume based on height and mass through regression analysis."
Expected response: "Load dataset, calculate volume, split dataset, perform regression on volume using height and mass, calculate MSE."

- Example with multiple complex attributes:
Input: "Predict volume based on density and surface through regression analysis."
Expected response: "Load dataset, calculate volume and density, split dataset, perform regression on volume using density and surface, calculate MSE."

- Example without complex attribute:
Input: "Predict surface based on mass through regression analysis."
Expected response: "Load dataset, split dataset, perform regression on surface using mass, calculate MSE."
