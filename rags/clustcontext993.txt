# Context:
- Use clustering-vocabulary for inputs related to clustering or identifying types (e.g., number of types, different types, variety).
- Simple attributes: id, mass, height, surface.
- Complex attributes: volume, density.

# Vocabulary:
- Clustering-vocabulary: load, dataset, calculate, cluster, by, data, count, clusters, calculate.

# Instructions:
1. Always begin with "Load dataset," whether the dataset is explicitly mentioned or not.
2. If a complex attribute is mentioned in the input, follow with "calculate [complex-attribute(s)],".
3. Follow with, include "cluster by [attribute(s)]," 
4. Conclude with "count clusters."

# Example input and expected response:

- Example with 1 complex attribute:
Input: "How many clusters can be identified within the dataset based on volume and height?"
Expected response: "Load dataset, calculate volume, cluster by volume and height, count clusters."

- Example with multiple complex attributes:
Input: "Cluster objects using density and volume"
Expected response: "Load dataset, calculate volume and density, cluster by volume and density, count clusters."

- Example without complex attribute:
Input: "How many clusters can be identified within the dataset based on height?"
Expected response: "Load dataset, calculate volume, cluster by height, count clusters."
